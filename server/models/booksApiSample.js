      'This is not your typical programming book! Jump right in with interesting, useful programs, some of which are drawn from classic computer science problems as a way of talking about the programming constructs in the language rather than explaining everything in a dry, theoretical manner that doesn’t translate well to implementation. Rust programming has been the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016! Learn why programmers are using Rust due to it\'s performance and efficency, without the errors and crashes that a programmer would find in common languages such as C and C++. Built around solving real problems, this book will help introduce you to computer science problems that can be built upon to create solutions for other problems. LEARN BY DOING: This book will focus on a practical approach to learing Rust. You will learn all of the language fundamentals through the use of programming examples that do interesting things! All of the programs covered will be based on a computer science problem or othre interesting problems that can be used as a foundation for demonstrating language syntax, data types and structures, and other features or techniques for developing programs.',

      'Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research. Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics. The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area. The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas. The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming. - Covers the whole field of constraint programming - Survey-style chapters - Five chapters on applications',

      "How do you select the right programming language for the right job? Austin and Chancogne provide students with a collection of four tutorials that cover concepts in modern engineering computations, and engineering programming in Ansi C, Matlab Version 5, and Java 1.1. The text gives practical guidance on selecting the best programming language for a project through a large number of working examples. With the help of these examples, students will learn how to design, write, and execute engineering programs using these programming languages. By incorporating Ansi C, Matlab, and Java into one text, students will quickly learn the strengths and weaknesses of each language. They'll do this with the help of the 56 case study programs and 115 programming exercises integrated throughout the book. A small suite of basic engineering problems is also implemented in each of the three programming languages. The four tutorials featured in the book include: * Modern Engineering Computations - covers hardware components in a simple computer, operating systems, networks (including the Internet and World Wide Web), and an overview of programming languages. * C Tutorial - teaches students how to write multi-function C programs. Topics include basic data types, operators and expressions, program control, functions, dynamic memory allocation, and input/output. * Matlab - shows students how to solve simple matrix programs with simple graphics. This tutorial also demonstrates how MATLAB programs can be much shorter than equivalent implementations in C or Java. * Java - explains how Java got started, about object-oriented program design, and how to write Java programs with platform-independent graphical user interfaces that can operate across the Internet.",
